This data aims to measure the intersections of climate change, food system resilience, and racial equity. Variables measured include household food insecurity rates, costs per meal, percentage of households receiving SNAP, agricultural production, and percentage of households with low store access. A full pdf with variable definitions can be found here.\n\n\nMap\nI chose to make my map measuring the average cost per meal in each US state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFrom this map, we can visualize that high meal costs correlate more strongly with states on the coasts of the US. Costs range from about $2.90 to $4.50. Average meal prices are highest in District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Lowest prices are in Kentucky, Texas, and Indiana. The following tables show the exact average costs for the five highest and five lowest states.\n\n\n\n\n\nstate_name\navg_cost_per_meal\n\n\n\n\ndistrict of columbia\n4.490000\n\n\nmassachusetts\n4.201429\n\n\nrhode island\n4.174000\n\n\nvermont\n4.045714\n\n\nconnecticut\n3.906250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstate_name\navg_cost_per_meal\n\n\n\n\nkentucky\n2.906000\n\n\ntexas\n2.930669\n\n\nindiana\n2.950761\n\n\narkansas\n2.972533\n\n\nwest virginia\n3.021818\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Districts\n\nIntroduction\nIn February of 2024, Wisconsin’s governor signed an act that will begin the process of redistricting. Wisconsin’s districts have been considered some of the most gerrymandered districts in the country, since the districts were decided in 2011. This has cemented a republican majority, even if they represent close to, or even less than 50% of voters. This new map of congressional districts may change the results of following elections in Wisconsin.\n\n\nMaps\nThe following two maps show the election results in the house of representatives in 2016. This first one shows which party won in each district.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second map shows the margins by which the party won that district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn these maps, particularly the second one, it can be seen that republicans had close margins in their races, sometimes winning by only a little over 50%. This is best seen in district 6. Democrats are clustered more heavily in districts 2 and 3. How these margins will change with new congressional district lines will be interesting with the coming 2024 election.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nFederal Election Commission\nUrban Data Catalog"

I decided for this project to look through Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources data in the Twin Cities and run statistical tests comparing this year to other years. I chose to run simulations to find where this year’s snowfall lies in comparison to other years to see if it is truly statistically less snow than other years.\nBefore doing any analysis on this data, it needed to be cleaned. The columns were mostly character vectors, with some double vectors. This made it difficult to pivot, parse, and convert missing data to NAs; each step had to be done to each column instead of the whole data set at once. The values ‘T’ for trace needed to be converted to zeros, and ‘M’ for missing needed to be changed into NA values. Finally, parse_number() changed the character vectors into double vectors, allowing R to find the mean and other statistics. This is the function I attempted to use:\n\nfix_columns &lt;- function(data, x) {\n  data |&gt;\n    mutate(x = ifelse({{ x }} == \"M\", NA, {{ x }}),\n           x = ifelse({{ x }} == \"T\", 0, {{ x }}),\n           x = ifelse({{ x }} == \"T*\", NA, {{ x }}),\n           x = parse_number({{ x }}))\n}\n\nThis first graph provides an initial look at how much snow the Twin Cities have gotten each year since 1884.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data seems to be right-skewed, with possible high outliers. Of course, this data would change with inclusion of the months March and April, but as those haven’t happened yet in 2024, they can’t yet be compared to this year.\n\n\nSimulation\nThis is the code I used to run a simulation and create a randomized data set of snowfall in 140 years.\nFirst, this chunk shows the true difference between 2023-2024 season’s snowfall, and the snowfall each season from 1884-2023. This is an observed difference of about 4 inches each month. This means that on average, this winter season has had 4 inches less snow than other months on average. This is my alternate hypothesis.\n\nsnowfall_summary &lt;- snowfall |&gt;\n  group_by(year_group) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_snowfall = mean(snow_per_month))\nobserved_diff &lt;- snowfall_summary[[2]][2] - snowfall_summary[[2]][1]\n\nThe next step in this simulation is to create simulated data for each year grouping: both 2023-2024 and 1884-1885 through 2022-2023. This multiplies our original observed difference by 1000, assuming that the true difference is zero. This is the null hypothesis, in contrast to my alternate hypothesis in the chunk above.\n\nsimulated_diffs &lt;- vector(\"double\", 1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000) {\n  snowfall_summary &lt;- snowfall |&gt;\n    mutate(year_group = sample(year_group)) |&gt;\n    group_by(year_group) |&gt;\n    summarize(mean_snowfall = mean(snow_per_month))\n  simulated_diffs[[i]] &lt;- snowfall_summary[[2]][2] - snowfall_summary[[2]][1]\n}  \n\n\n\nResults\nUsing this new randomized data, I created a histogram showing the spread of the simulated differences between this season and all other seasons, assuming the null hypothesis. The red vertical line represents the difference of 4 from this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the simulated data, we can pull the p-value of this year’s snowfall to see if it falls within the upper 5% of the spread.\nThe p-value is 0.182.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nStatistically Insignifiant Results\nBecause of the p-value this simulation produced at a significance level of 0.05, the amount of snow this year would not be considered significantly less than usual. About 18% of the time that this simulation is run, a difference of 4 inches per month or more will be observed. Therefore, this season’s amount of snowfall isn’t statistically unusual.\n\n\nAreas for Future Research\nThere are a few changes I would make to this simulation if I were to run it again, or if I had more time.\n\nIncomplete Data\nThis graph shows snowfall for the whole year, not just the months October through February.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne potential shortcoming of the simulation I created is that the data doesn’t cover months that often get large amounts of snowfall. If I were to run this again in two months with data from March and April, the results might change. As this graph shows, there are less gaps when including all of the months, and it would increase the mean, and alter the standard deviation.\n\n\nOther Applications\nI would also be interested in running this test for last year’s snowfall! In 2022-2023, the Twin Cities got 90.3 inches of snow. From the histogram, this seems like one of the higher years on record. Now that I have this simulation set up, it would be easy to alter it to run different tests, both on this data set, and on others I find."

Our task to find a data set to analyze with strings was almost too easy because the options are endless. I found a data set I liked that had a list of all birds that have been found in Minnesota. Using string functions and regular expressions, I ran a variety of tests to find patterns in bird names, such as colors, possessive apostrophes, and alliterations.\n\n\nColors\nFor the first analysis of these birds, I looked at which colors birds are named for most often. I chose to only extract basic colors of the rainbow, plus black, gray, and white. From the graph, we can see that birds in Minnesota are mostly named for the color black, then red and white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames\nA hot topic in the birding community is whether a large chunk of birds should be renamed. What’s causing this need for change? Racism, mostly. And sexism. The American Ornithological Society made the decision to rename all birds whose names are eponyms, or named directly for a person. Many birds are named after historical figures, often whoever discovered them. More often than not, these people were hurtful and the legacies they carry on through the names of birds can create an environment minority birders don’t feel they are welcome in.\nThis article by NPR highlights the way some of these bird’s names have been exclusionary in the past, and how some are responding to this change. In an interview with Kenn Kaufman, a longtime author of bird guides, he tells of how he came around to the change.\nAnother compelling reason for this change is to showcase a unique characteristic of the bird. For example, ‘Townsend’s Warbler’ doesn’t bring a vivid picture to one’s mind, but ‘Black-Throated Gray Warbler’ does, or ‘Hermit Warbler’ indicates something about the bird’s behavior.\nThis following table provides a look at the names of birds that will be changing in the near future! If you see birds you know and love, what do you think they should be named? The American Ornithological Society has committed to including the public in deciding new names, so your input could be taken into account!\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\nRoss's goose\n\n\nBarrow's goldeneye\n\n\nClark's grebe\n\n\nChuck-will's-widow\n\n\nRivoli's hummingbird\n\n\nAnna's hummingbird\n\n\nCosta's hummingbird\n\n\nWilson's plover\n\n\nBaird's sandpiper\n\n\nWilson's snipe\n\n\nWilson's phalarope\n\n\nSabine's gull\n\n\nBonaparte's gull\n\n\nRoss's gull\n\n\nFranklin's gull\n\n\nForster's tern\n\n\nCooper's hawk\n\n\nSwainson's hawk\n\n\nLewis's woodpecker\n\n\nWilliamson's sapsucker\n\n\nCassin's kingbird\n\n\nSay's phoebe\n\n\nBell's vireo\n\n\nClark's nutcracker\n\n\nBewick's wren\n\n\nTownsend's solitaire\n\n\nSwainson's thrush\n\n\nSprague's pipit\n\n\nCassin's finch\n\n\nSmith's longspur\n\n\nBrewer's sparrow\n\n\nHarris's sparrow\n\n\nLeConte's sparrow\n\n\nNelson's sparrow\n\n\nBaird's sparrow\n\n\nHenslow's sparrow\n\n\nLincoln's sparrow\n\n\nBullock's oriole\n\n\nScott's oriole\n\n\nBrewer's blackbird\n\n\nMacGillivray's warbler\n\n\nKirtland's warbler\n\n\nTownsend's warbler\n\n\nWilson's warbler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlliterations\nAs a fun little analysis of this data set, I decided to look for alliterations in these bird’s names!

I decided to see if these groupings of birds had high proportions of alliterative names.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the highest proportion of alliterative names in these groups is for the stilts and avocets - of which there are only two.\n\n\nLargest Birds\nAlthough this section doesn’t use string functions to carry out analysis, we learned about tree maps in class, and I wanted to use an application of this visualization in my project.\nThese following tree maps show the largest groups of birds on average by their wingspan, length, and body mass. Larger squares correspond with larger wingpans, lengths or body masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordcloud\nFor a final visualization, I made a wordcloud of the common words in bird’s names. The larger words are ones that appear most frequently. I chose to make this visualization with the 120 most often occurring words. Some of the most common words, such as ‘warbler’ or ‘sparrow’, occur frequently because there are many types included in the data set."
